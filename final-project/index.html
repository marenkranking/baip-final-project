            <p>What comes to mind when you think about film? We’re not talking about Marvel and DC movies, but those little rolls of film paper wound up on a spool that you might have seen at a one-hour photo store in the 1990s.</p>

            <p>Motion pictures relied solely on film photography technologies for a whole century after the birth of cinematography in 1880. This was largely overturned after the introduction of digital cinematography, and by 2013, most major films were shot on digital video.</p>
                
            <p>Does that mean that film is dead? Absolutely not.</p>
                
            <p>Plenty of movies and shows loved by the younger generation today were shot on film. In fact, the director of Euphoria, Sam Levinson, reached out to Kodak for help collecting enough film stock to shoot an entire season in the 35mm format. According to the director, shooting in film could help create a more restricted version of the show that mimicked the worn-out youth that the story follows.</p>
                
            <p>Besides Euphoria, movies such as Call Me By Your Name, and La La Land were also shot entirely on film.</p>
                
            <p>In addition, social media influencers and celebrities play a huge role in creating the rising demand for film photography.</p>
                
            <p>Among the many celebrities who publicly announced their love for film photography, Kendall Jenner might be most responsible for “bringing back” film photography. From shooting in film at the Met Gala to discussing her new Contax T2 film camera on “The Tonight Show” last year, she has become a contemporary protagonist in film photography.</p>
                
            <p>A new wave of young film-photography lovers is emerging as part of the analog media resurgence.</p>

                    <p>Chris Chu is a photographer and YouTuber based in the Bay Area. He heavily utilizes film in his creative work.</p>
                        
                    <p>In 2019, Chris dropped out of the computer science program at San Jose State University in order to pursue a career in photography and content creation.</p>
                        
                    <p>“I was ready to like kind of just go out on my own, honestly be homeless as well, because I was willing to like die for this."</p>
            
                    <p> Since then, Chris has been making a living from freelance photography and producing photography-related videos on YouTube and other social media platforms. While a lot of his commercial photos for clients are shot on digital cameras, Chris still spends a lot of time shooting with film cameras.</p>
                        
                    <p>“I just really enjoy the way slower process of making photos through film,” he said.</p>
                        
                    <p>During his career as a photographer, Chris has encountered many obstacles. Among them, the rising price of film rolls has drastically changed both his work and his lifestyle.</p>
                        
                    <h4 class="subhed">Film inflation</h4>

                    <p>Prices of film, particularly Kodak film, have increased by 50%. And for some films, their prices nearly doubled over the past three years. Much of that price increase predates COVID-19 by a lot, and yet, there have been no new films since Ektachrome E100. If you go to a film shop today, you will likely see mainly empty shelves with price tags that are going up constantly.</p>
                        
                    <p>[quote from Matt/anecdote that explains how fast film runs out or how much the price has increased] joshuajung2024@u.northwestern.edu can you write this part</p>
                        
                    <p>The inflated prices of camera film are primarily due to its fluctuating demand, as well as the complex manufacturing processes used to create film. Color film did not become popular until the mid 20th century, with prices at about $5 per roll. Due to its increasing popularity in the United States, more and more companies started to produce their own film, which drove down prices to $3-5 per roll. While more companies were trying to get a piece of the film market, the incredibly high prices of the manufacturing equipment kept most businesses from entering the market. High end film manufacturing machines, like those owned by Kodak, cost hundreds of thousands of dollars each. This initial cost alone was enough to keep most competitors out of the film industry in the mid 20th century.</p>
                        
                    <div id="graph" class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8814646"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

                    <p>After color film took over the market in the 1970s, the primary competitors began refining their manufacturing techniques to keep film prices consistent with what they were 20 years prior. In fact, film stayed at about $5 per roll until the 90s due to improved manufacturing processes. In the 90s, however, the introduction of the digital camera created a massive decline in the demand for film. With a declining market for film, many of the key players in the filmmaking industry like Forte and Agfa-Gevaert declared bankruptcy. Between the years of 2003-2008, the market for film was shrinking at a rate of 30% per year, leaving many companies unsure of their value in the film industry. By the early 2010s, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Agfaphoto, Ilford, and Foton had all exited the film market. With many of the major players throwing in the towel, the supply of film was at an all time low, and film became a luxury product. Companies were no longer competing to improve manufacturing processes, and it seemed hopeless for the film industry.</p>
                        
                    <p>Likely due to its nostalgic feel and vibrant aesthetic, the market for film started to grow again in 2013. Even though companies like Kodak were able to profit in the fim market for the first time in years, the equipment they used was so expensive that nobody else was interested in rejoining the market after the crash. Ferrania, an Italian film manufacturer, raised over $320,000 in 2017 to pay for film manufacturing equipment, and a few other companies like Ilford followed shortly after. With a rapidly growing demand for film as well as inflated silver prices, the cost of film rolls spiked. Only a few companies in the world had the supplies necessary to produce high quality film rolls, and they could not keep up with the increasing demand for film during the pandemic. The rapidly growing demand caused film rolls to hit a price of nearly $18 per roll in 2021, which angered photographers around the world. The inflated prices kept many experienced photographers from shooting film and left the future of film production uncertain.</p>
                        
                    <p>So how does the increasing price of film affect photographers like Chris Chu? According to Chris, a huge majority of film photographers in the Bay Area chose to quit film photography after Kodak announced yet another price increase in its products following a series of price increases.</p>

                    <p>“This is, I think, the third year in a row that they [Kodak] raised their prices like 20%, 20%, 20%. And it was like wild. I’m like, $17 for 10 shots? That’s crazy!”</p>

                    <p>Although Chris personally did not stop taking photos on film cameras, he also had to make major lifestyle changes to accommodate for the rising cost of film.</p>
                        
                    <p>“I totally cut out coffee in my, like, daily life, ” Chris said. “I just needed to still have film in my workflow personally, because I value it so much.”</p>
                        
                    <p>In addition to the cost of film that can prevent one from picking up film photography as a hobby, it also takes much longer for a photo taken on a film camera to come to life. Unlike photos taken on digital cameras, you aren’t able to see your photo until after a lengthy process of photo development, which could take anywhere from hours to weeks depending on the availability and accessibility of dark rooms.</p>
                        
                    <p>“There was one time where a marketing person was with me on the shoot. And they saw my film camera, like while I was using they're like, Oh, can I review the images?” Chis said. “I was like, unfortunately, I can't do that. And then their confidence, like tanked. Oh, and then they're like, Wait, like, we need to be able to see these, like, right from the get-go. So I switched [to a DSLR camera].”</p>
                        
                    <p>While it is not ideal to have to wait days or weeks to see what your photos look like, this unique experience of delayed gratification is actually a major selling point for many photographers who are looking for a slower-paced workflow or lifestyle.</p>
                        
                    <p>Joy Zheng is a senior at Northwestern University. She is currently taking an introduction to film photography course and experimenting with the world of black and white film photography.</p>
                        
                    <p>Joy learned how to develop film on her first day of class. “ [It was] like everything you see in the movies. There was like a red light, and then suddenly I was faced with ‘no you're going to have to like take your roll, prop it open with the bottle opener, take it out, put it on the reel, and put that reel in a container all completely in the dark,” she said.</p>
                        
                    <p>“I was just like: this is scary, this is intimidating. What happens if I drop my film on the ground? I'm never going to find it.”</p>
                        
                    <p>After a few weeks of practice, Joy can now finish this entire process within five minutes.</p>
                        
                    <p>“[When I was] developing my first test strip, you know when you dip into the developer, it’s just blank for like 30 seconds and then all of a sudden, everything comes out. It starts like filling in, the black and white start coming out, it's just like you get to like essentially see it before your eyes and it’s just so fascinating.”</p>
                        
                    <p>“And even now [when I develop the photos] I'm just like oh my God what’s it going to be? Do I have the right exposure? Is it going to be too grey? Is it going to be too dark? It's still like an exciting waiting process.”</p>
                        
                    <p>“It’s fun and engaging in the sense that there is a lot that could go wrong, but when it goes right it just feels so great,” she said. “It’s just a lot of anticipation. You have to have a lot of patience for this in comparison to digital.”</p>
